            Latino LinQ is a nonprofit organization in Georgia advocating for a
            world in which Latinx LGTBQ+ individuals and their families can live
            authentically, with dignity and respect. Our mission is to increase
            equity and promote wellbeing for Latinx LGBTQ+ communities
            throughout the South.

          <div>
            We are seeking a Summit Manager for a grant-funded position who is
            detail-oriented, self-driven, and holds a passion for racial
            justice, HIV prevention, mental and sexual health. This individual
            will manage the third iteration of Latino LinQ’s LGBTQ Summit. As a
            volunteer-led and operated organization, once a year Latino LinQ
            brings together Georgia's Latinx LGBTQ community for a one day
            Summit with workshops and speakers on topics impacting our
            wellbeing. This Summit is the only Latinx LGBTQ-led educational
            event in Georgia. This year’s Summit will be centered around
            buildingracial and gender justice and will rely heavily on building
            partnerships with Black and Transgender-led organizations in the
            metro-Atlanta region. Alongside the Latino LinQ board, the Summit
            Manager will plan a convening to build bridges between LGBTQ-Latinx
            and LGBTQ-Black communities and that strengthen relationships
            between LGB and Transgender folks. The Latino LinQ board believes
            that in order to address key issues facing both Black and Latinx
            LGBTQ individuals (ie. HIV, over-policing, racism, transphobia,
            inadequate access to vital resources), reconciling our differences
            and fortifying unity is necessary.
